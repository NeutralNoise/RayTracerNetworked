# Networked Ray Tracer

## What is this?
This is port of my C# Ray Tracer to C++ with addded networking.

## Networking? What do you mean.
Back in about 2008 I read an article about quake wars being rendered using ray tracing.
In this article they said that at one point it was set up to render on 4 netowrked
computers just to get (semi?) useable framerates. So this has spured my crative side
and I thought that I would have a go at something like this. I don't expect to have high framerates but it should be faster then one computer. Should being the key word there.

## What can this do.
Currently nothing.
